# The SER-Libras character encoding
#
# This encoding is based on Unicode's private use area in block 14.
# Characters not in this file but within specified blocks are considered undefined characters.
# Any Unicode encoding capable of representing all code points in the rages specified bellow may be used. UTF-8 is recommended.
# The table bellow has the character blocks for reference.
# Block E8001 - EFFFD is intended for private use SER-Libras characters and do not have defined characters to any of its code points.

# The syntax:
# Lines that begin with a hash character (#) are ignored, along with empty lines.
# The file, apart from the hash-commented lines is a comma-separated values file with semicolon separator (;).
#
# Each line represents a code point.
# The first value of each line is the code point in hex for padded to 5 digits, the human-readable "U+" prefix is omitted.
# The following values are the character names, the fist value shall be taken as the authoritative character name when multiple names are present.
# This file is encoded in UTF-8.
